This script will download the latest tarballs, extract them, compile each,
and install the Nagios monitoring program. 
You will need to have a few things before this will work correctly. 
INSTALL: 
make
php
httpd
gcc
glibc
glibc-common
gd
gd-devel
openssl-devel
xinted

#___________________What You Need To do First_______________
Create the user ( and possiblely group) that you will be 
running the program with. 
DEFAULT: nagios ( for user and group)
DEFAULT: nagiosadmin ( for website)


#_____________________About the Script______________________
You will need to have a list of the latest tarballs 
links for the script to download. This can be done from the Nagios site
or from you own hosts. 
Each link needs to be on different lines, as to conform with the download. 

Example:
http://www.example.com/path/to/nagios-3.1.24.tar.gz
http://www.sample.com/this/is/nagios-plugins-1.4.1.tar.gz
http://www.example.com/dir/is/nrpe.tar.gz

The same pattern can be said for the OPTIONS file, when each option needs to
be on different lines. 
OPTIONS file is for what you would use when calling './configure'
This file is needed for the basics of:
nagios admin/gui user
nagios process user

The format is:
--with-nagios-user=[USERNAME]
--with-nagios-group=[GROUPNAME]
--with-command-user=[PROCusername]
--with-command-group=[PROCGROUP]

There are many options that you can use. Please feel free to take
a look at the Nagios Documentation for details and decriptions. 

This files is not needed if you want to 
go with the default of:
nagiosadmin (for the GUI)
nagios (for process)
